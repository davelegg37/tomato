		<div>Repeat</div>
		<div>The Lonely Tomatoes</div>
		<div>Next</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>Listen</div>
		<div>The seed was planted in Mother Nature's garden and, with the help of Chance, sprouted in that nurturing environment. The spring rains quenched its thirst and the warm summer sun supplied it with the energy to convert the nutrients of the rich garden soil into the roots, stems, vines and leaves of a tomato plant. By mid summer the tiny seed that had sprouted in the spring had been transformed into a luxurious mature plant, a very impressive addition to Mother Nature's garden.
</div>
		<div>It was at this stage in the plant’s life that the first tomatoes began to develop. At first the tomatoes were little and green, but as time went on they grew bigger and turned from green to red. As they ripened they began to develop intelligence.  Along with their intellectual growth came a curiosity about their origins. "Where did we come from? How did we come to be living on this plant? Where had the plant come from?" All these questions became of great importance to the tomatoes.</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>They began to understand what they came to see as the almost miraculous complexity of their development. "How could this have happened? How could we have developed from such a tiny seed?" Some thought it was due to a miracle.  Others thought it had come about simply by chance.  But whatever the explanation the tomatoes believed that they were indeed unique and special. They stood at the pinnacle of the tomato plant's development. Tomatoes have very limited sensory perception. They can't see, smell, hear, or feel, so the tomatoes had to rely on the intellectual tools of logic and reason to seek answers to these questions. As they became more sophisticated in the use of these tools,  the tomatoes were able to reconstruct with a high degree of accuracy their development from a tiny seed. Some tomatoes had even been able to deduce their connection with the garden.
</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>From this rather egocentric vantage point tomatoes began to consider their place in the garden.
Of course due to their lack of sensory perception the tomatoes were totally unaware of all the other plants with which they shared the garden. They felt utterly alone in the garden.</div>
		<div>Summer drew to an end and the early autumn chill gave warning of the tomato plant's future. The tomato's logic was inescapable, "The plant is doomed," they concluded. "When the plant dies so do we. Tomatoes will disappear from the garden and the garden will return to the innate lump of clay it was before we developed."
</div>
		<div>Mother Nature observed the tomatoes, depression.  "If they only knew,”  she thought, "but of course they never can."
The nights got colder and the tomatoes' depression deepened. One night the inevitable freeze occurred and the plant died along with all the tomatoes on its vines.
Mother Nature looked down at the wilted vines and the dead tomatoes. "Poor dears," she thought. "How unhappy they were at the end."  But she quickly busied herself with thoughts of next years garden and all the wonderful plants that she and Chance would grow.                                            The End
